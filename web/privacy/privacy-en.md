# Privacy Policy

Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly app, including its contents, and the services offered there.

Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.

The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.

Our privacy policy is structured as follows:

* I. Information about us as controllers of your data
* II. The rights of users and data subjects
* III. Information about the data processing

## I. Information about us as controllers of your data

The party responsible for this app (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:

    Fabian Rosenthal
    c/o skriptspektor e. U.
    Robert-Preußler-Straße 13 / TOP 1
    5020 Salzburg
    AT – Österreich
    code [at] xennis.org

The controller's data protection officer is:

    Fabian Rosenthal

## II. The rights of users and data subjects

With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right

* to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
* to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
* to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
* to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
* to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).

In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.

**Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.**

## III. Information about the data processing

Your data processed when using our app will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics on our app. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).

Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield

https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active

Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.

The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our app is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.

Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our app will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.

The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our app and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our app and of the internet in general.

Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners,

including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.

Deactivation takes place in the app in the settings. To do this, open the settings of the app. You can deactivate the service on this page.

### Firebase Crashlytics

We use Firebase Crashlytics in our app. This is a crash report service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as "Google".

Through certification according to the EU-US data protection shield ("EU-US Privacy Shield")

https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active

Google guarantees that the EU's data protection requirements will also be complied with when processing data in the USA.

In order to be able to improve the reliability and stability of the app, we depend on anonymized crash reports. If the app crashes, anonymous information is transferred to Google's servers in the USA (status of the app at the time of the crash, installation UUID, crash trace, manufacturer and operating system of the mobile phone, last log messages). This information does not contain any personal data.

The legal basis for the data transfer is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. For Android apps, when setting up the mobile device, you have the option of generally agreeing to the transmission of crash notifications to Google and app developers.

In the case of Android apps, the deactivation takes place in the Android settings. To do this, open the settings, select the item "Google" and there in the three-point menu the menu item "Use & Diagnosis". Here you can deactivate the sending of the relevant data. You can find more information in the help for your [Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en).

Further information on data protection can be found in the data protection information from Firebase Crashlytics at https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.
